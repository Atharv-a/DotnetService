# Game Inventory Microservice
• Developed two interconnected RESTful API services in a microservices architecture: Catalog Service for CRUD
  operations on game items and Inventory Service for managing user-specific inventory items.
• Used MongoDB and RabbitMQ for data storage and facilitating asynchronous service-to-service communication.
• Utilized Docker and docker-compose for seamless containerization, deployment, and scalability of services.
• Deployed and hosted the entire system on AWS EC2, guaranteeing robustness and high availability of services.
